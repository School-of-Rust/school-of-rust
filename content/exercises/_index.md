I've noticed that a common question asked by people learning Rust is something like:

> "Does anyone have any examples of a small project I could create? I've learned
> the basics, but I want a real-world thing to create to practice actually building
> a working piece of software from beginning to end."
>
> *&#8212; Troubled Rustacean*

My goal here is to have series' of exercises that provide exactly this. These will
usually be in the form of small example programs they will write. These programs
will have clearly defined goals and parameters, so the author will be able to build
them and test if they work correctly.
