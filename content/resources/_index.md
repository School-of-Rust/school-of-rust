There are a lot of other great resources for learning Rust, so I want
to highlight some of the best ones here!

### Other Websites

- [Crates.io](https://crates.io/) is the official Rust package depository. It seems obvious to put here, but everyone
uploads their crates here and you can often find amazing crates just by searching keywords!

- [Read Rust](https://readrust.net/) is a website that aggregates interesting posts related to the Rust programming
language. It is organized into sections based on different interests.

- [Are We Game Yet?](https://arewegameyet.rs/) is a collection of several crates useful for game developers using
Rust. You'll find crates for vector math, graphics, networking, entities, scripting, and more.

- [Are We Learning Yet?](https://www.arewelearningyet.com/) is similar to the above, but for those interested in
using Rust for machine learning.

- [Are We Web Yet?](https://www.arewewebyet.org/) is another collection, but for web development.

### Video

- [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset) has a YouTube channel where he uploads his entire coding
streams. These are often videos of him developing entire crates or systems, and walking the viewer through it
every step of the way and answering questions.

### Conferences

- [RustConf](https://rustconf.com/) is an annual conference for Rust held in Portland.

- [RustFest](https://rustfest.global/) is Europe's largest Rust conference.

### Communities

- [The Offical Rust Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rust-lang) is a place you can get help, but also keep tabs
on the development of Rust itself, as well as see what people are doing in different domains.

- [Game Development in Rust](https://discord.gg/yNtPTb2) is a Discord server specifically for those interested in
creating games. You can share your works-in-progress and even joins their monthly meetups.

### Practice & Exercises

- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is a Github repository with several small exercises to get
you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages.

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event where you can solve small (but high quality)
programming puzzles in any language you want. There is one puzzle for each of the 25 days leading up to Christmas.
