# <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Learn Rust & Get Creative

Welcome to *School of Rust*, an educational website with lessons and
tutorials to help people learn the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Rust has a reputation for being hard to learn, so our goal is to provide
*high quality* learning material to help break down those barriers.
