# <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Learn Rust and Get Creative

Welcome to *School of Rust*, an educational website with lessons and
tutorials to help people learn the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Rust is a wonderful language with some of the most amazing tools and
helpful community I have experienced in many decades of coding. But
it has a reputation for being hard to learn, both for newcomers *and*
experienced coders.

The goal of this website is to provide *high quality* learning material
to help people break down those barriers so we can all make quality
software and art together.

# Header 1

```rs,linenos
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Here is a warning block...

> ### <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> WARNING
>
> This is a warning!

Some text after the warning block.

## Header 2

Here is a `paragraph` that is going to be several lines long. I want to make sure that
putting some `InlineCode` in the paragraph won't mess up the line heights at all,
because I want all lines to always be the same height.
