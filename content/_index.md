Welcome to *School of Rust*, an educational website with lessons and
tutorials to help people learn the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Rust can be hard to learn, but it is [beloved](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)
by those who use it (including myself). My goal is to provide a variety of
lessons to help you get coding proficiently in Rust.

Let's create fast, secure, and high quality software together!
