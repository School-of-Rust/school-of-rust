This is a series of tutorials to teach the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

Rust can be notoriously tricky to learn for a beginner (it was for me!), so
my goal with this series is to teach it in a way that makes it more accessible
and fun!

Our goal is to create a canvas that we can put pixels on as fast as possible.
From there, learning Rust becomes a place where we can play and learn creatively.
