Let's learn some Rust! The lessons are mostly ordered by difficulty.

As you follow these courses, you're encouraged to join our
[<i class="fa-brands fa-discord"></i> Discord](https://discord.gg/wwrFVYaqhr),
where you can ask for help or suggest feedback. If there are lessons that
are confusing to you, I would love to know how I can improve them.

You are also welcome to message us on [<i class="fa-brands fa-twitter"></i> Twitter](https://twitter.com/SchoolRust)
with your feedback and suggestions.

> ### <i class="fa-solid fa-warning"></i> WORK IN PROGRESS
> Lessons are still being developed, so there are none available at this time. Thanks for your patience, and stay tuned!
