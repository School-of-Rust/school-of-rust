## Part One

The first puzzle, summed up, asks us to do the following:

- count the total calories of food each elf is carrying
- find which elf is carrying the most and report that number

The data is given to us as a series of numbers grouped together, where each group represents
the calorie value for one or more items that elf is carrying.

The example input has the inventory of 5 different elves:

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

The solution to this puzzle is `24000`, because elf #4 is carrying the most calories worth of food,
at `7000 + 8000 + 9000 = 24000` total.

### Setting up the Test

First, we want to make a unit test where we can test this input data against our known solution:

```rust
#[test]
fn test() {
    let input = include_str!("day1_test.txt");
    assert_eq!(solve_part1(test_input), 24000);
}

fn solve_part1(input: &str) -> i32 {
    todo!()
}
```

If **`solve_part1()`** fails to generate the correct solution for the test input, we know that our code is
faulty. This is because [`assert_eq!()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_eq.html) will panic the 
program if the two values are not equal, and any unit tests that panic will report as failures.

> The [`include_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html) macro is a standard-library
> macro in Rust. I can feed it a text file (relative to this source file's location), and it will
> yield a `&'static str` value I can store in a variable directly.
>

Many puzzle solvers use a text editor to turn their input directly into arrays they can use
in their code directly. This is a perfectly valid approach, but for fun and learning, let's actually
parse this from a text file directly.

### Splitting Into Groups

The first thing we need to do is to split this test into individual elves, separated by blank lines.

We can utilize the [`str::split()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.split) method to do this:

```rust
fn solve_part1(input: &str) -> i32 {
    input.split("\n\n").for_each(|elf| {
        println!("ELF: `{}`", elf);
    });
    todo!()
}
```

We split the input string into an iterator of substrings, separated by empty lines (which we detect by searching
for two `\n` characters in a row). This code outputs:

```
ITEMS: '1000
2000
3000'
ITEMS: '4000'
ITEMS: '5000
6000'
ITEMS: '7000
8000
9000'
ITEMS: '10000'
```

Each of these `items` strings now contains all the calorie values belonging to an individual elf, separated by lines.

We can then, for each elf, use [`str::lines()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#method.lines)
to iterate over each of its calorie values:

```rust,hl_lines=4
input.split("\n\n").for_each(|elf| {
    println!("ELF:");
    elf.lines().for_each(|cals: &str| println!("  + {}", cals));
});
```

Which prints out:

```
ELF:
  + 1000
  + 2000
  + 3000
ELF:
  + 4000
ELF:
  + 5000
  + 6000
ELF:
  + 7000
  + 8000
  + 9000
ELF:
  + 10000
```

### Finding the Largest

Now we've grouped the elves and we can read the individual calorie values of the items they
are carrying. Now, we have what we need to solve the first part of the problem:

- count the total calories of food each elf is carrying

To do that, we first use [`str::parse()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.parse)
to parse each value, converting it into an integer:

```rust
elf
    .lines()
    .map(|cals: &str| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap())
    .for_each(|cals: i32| println!("  + {}", cals));
```

We use [`map()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.map) which converts our
`&str` iterator into an `i32` iterator.

This outputs the same as before, but now that our values are actual numbers, we can replace `for_each()`
with the [`sum()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.sum) method, which
will add together all the `i32` calorie values for this elf into a final sum:

```rust
let total = elf
    .lines()
    .map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap())
    .sum::<i32>();
println!("ELF: {}", total);
```

Now, our output will have each elf and the total calories it is carrying:

```
ELF: 6000
ELF: 4000
ELF: 11000
ELF: 24000
ELF: 10000
```

And there it is, the elf carrying the most calories has our expected solution: `24000!`

Let's look at our whole function:

```rust
fn solve_part1(input: &str) -> i32 {
    input.split("\n\n").for_each(|elf| {
        let total = elf
            .lines()
            .map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap())
            .sum::<i32>();
        println!("ELF: {}", total);
    });
    todo!()
}
```

In order to find out which elf is carrying the most, we first have to convert our iterator 
into an iterator over each elf's `total` value. We do this again using `map()`, turning each
group of numbers into their sum.

We can then use the [`max()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.max) method.
This will iterate over all the elves' total values and return to use which one was the highest.

```rust
// turn each group into an i32 sum of its numbers
.map(|elf| elf.lines().map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).sum())
.max()         // find the maximum of those numbers
.unwrap_or(0)  // or zero if no numbers were found
```

### Testing Our Solution

With some slight clean-up, our solution looks like this (with some unneccessary
type-annotations removed):

```rust
fn solve_part1(input: &str) -> i32 {
    input
        .split("\n\n")
        .map(|elf| elf.lines().map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).sum())
        .max()
        .unwrap_or(0)
}
```

With that, we can return to our test and run it:

```rust
#[test]
fn test() {
    let input = include_str!("day1_test.txt");
    assert_eq!(solve_part1(input), 24000);
}
```

```
Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
```

*Success!* Our unit test did not fail. If our numbers did not match, `assert_eq!()` would fail
and we would see an error report like this:

```
thread 'test' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `24001`,
 right: `24000`', src/bin/day1.rs:10:5
```

### Solving Part One

Now we know our function works (at least on the test text), let's test it on our actual puzzle input!

I get Advent of Code to generate me a puzzle input and put it into [`day1.txt`](https://github.com/ChevyRay/aoc2022/blob/main/src/bin/day1.txt). All I have to do now is run my solver on that input text:

```rust
fn main() {
    let input = include_str!("day1.txt");
    println!("PART 1: {}", solve_part1(input));
}
```

```
PART 1: 67658
```

Let's submit that and see if we're correct...

> Your puzzle answer was `67658`.

Perfect! Part one is now complete.

## Part Two

Part two asks us to change our calculation:

- find the *top 3 elves* carrying the most calories
- add their totals together and report the sum

Given our original test input, we are told that the example solution is `45000`.

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000  ──┐
6000  ──┴── 11000 ──┐
                    │ 
7000  ──┐           │
8000    ├── 24000 ──┼── 45000
9000  ──┘           │
                    │
10000 ───── 10000 ──┘
```

If we sum up the calorie totals of our top 3 load-bearing elves in our example
input, we can see that it does indeed equal `45000`.

### Setting Up the Test

First, we want to expand our test to also test part two of the problem.

```rust
#[test]
fn test() {
    let input = include_str!("day1_test.txt");
    assert_eq!(solve_part1(input), 24000);
    assert_eq!(solve_part2(input), 45000);
}
```

And we'll need to create a function for solving the second part:

```rust
fn solve_part2(input: &str) -> i32 {
    todo!()
}
```

### Sorting the Totals

For part one, we used `max()` to return which total was the highest:

```rust
input
    .split("\n\n")
    .map(|elf| elf.lines().map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).sum())
    .max()
```

But now we want the *top 3* highest values.

To do this, I first need all the numbers
to be in a [`Vec<i32>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html), Rust's
"list" type. I can use the [`collect()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.collect)
method to collect an iterator into a heap-allocated vector.

```rust
let mut totals: Vec<i32> = input
    .split("\n\n")
    .map(|elf| elf.lines().map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).sum())
    .collect();
```

Once we've this, we can then use [`Vec::sort()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.sort)
to sort the values in ascending order.

```rust
totals.sort();
```

### Summing the Top Three

The last trick we need to do is to sum up the highest 3 values in the vector. Because the
vector is sorted, we want to sum the last 3 values at the end of it:

```rust
totals.iter().rev().take(3).sum()
```

You can read the above code like this:

- **iterate** over the totals
- in **reverse**
- **taking** the first **3** values we find
- and **summing** them up

### Testing Our Solution

We now have our finished part two solution:

```rust
fn solve_part2(input: &str) -> i32 {
    let mut totals: Vec<i32> = input
        .split("\n\n")
        .map(|elf| elf.lines().map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).sum())
        .collect();
    totals.sort();
    totals.iter().rev().take(3).sum()
}
```

Let's run our unit test again to see if it is correct:

```rust
#[test]
fn test() {
    let input = include_str!("day1_test.txt");
    assert_eq!(solve_part1(input), 24000);
    assert_eq!(solve_part2(input), 45000);
}
```

```
Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
```

No panics! It's looking good...

### Solving Part Two

Part two operates on the same input as part one, so let's solve it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let input = include_str!("day1.txt");
    println!("PART 1: {}", solve_part1(input));
    println!("PART 2: {}", solve_part2(input));
}
```

```
PART 1: 67658
PART 2: 200158
```

So we have determined that our 3 elves carrying the most calories are
carrying a sum total of `200158` calories. Let's submit our answer...

> Your puzzle answer was `200158`.

We are correct! And with that, day one is complete.

## The Final Code

Here is the full day 1 solution, which is also available
[on Github](https://github.com/ChevyRay/aoc2022).

```rust,linenos
fn main() {
    let input = include_str!("day1.txt");
    println!("PART 1: {}", solve_part1(input));
    println!("PART 2: {}", solve_part2(input));
}

#[test]
fn test() {
    let input = include_str!("day1_test.txt");
    assert_eq!(solve_part1(input), 24000);
    assert_eq!(solve_part2(input), 45000);
}

fn solve_part1(input: &str) -> i32 {
    input
        .split("\n\n")
        .map(|elf| elf.lines().map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).sum())
        .max()
        .unwrap_or(0)
}

fn solve_part2(input: &str) -> i32 {
    let mut totals: Vec<i32> = input
        .split("\n\n")
        .map(|elf| elf.lines().map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).sum())
        .collect();
    totals.sort();
    totals.iter().rev().take(3).sum()
}
```

And for fun, here's an alternative solution to part two that does not need to allocate a `Vec`
or call `sort()`. It's not as tidy looking, but see if you can figure out how it works:

```rust
fn solve_part2_alt(input: &str) -> i32 {
    input
        .split("\n\n")
        .map(|elf| elf.lines().map(|cals| cals.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).sum())
        .fold([0, 0, 0], |[a, b, c], cals| {
            if cals >= a {
                [cals, a, b]
            } else if cals >= b {
                [a, cals, b]
            } else if cals >= c {
                [a, b, cals]
            } else {
                [a, b, c]
            }
        })
        .into_iter()
        .sum()
}
```
