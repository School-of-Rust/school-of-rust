I'm Chevy Ray, a coder, writer, artist, and game designer from Canada.

I've been using Rust for about 3 years now, and it's become my go-to language
for every new project I start up.

I currently work for [Extremely OK Games](https://exok.com/), where we are developing
an action-exploration game called [Earthblade](https://exok.com/games/earthblade/).

I've released many games, the most recent is [Ikenfell](https://www.humblegames.com/games/ikenfell/), which we released
on the *Nintendo Switch*, *Playstation 4*, *XBox One*, and PC.
