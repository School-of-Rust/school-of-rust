I'm Chevy Ray, a coder, writer, artist, and game designer from Canada.

I've been passionately using Rust for several years now, and use it every opportunity I can.
I consider myself a fairly advanced *Rustacean*, though my knowledge is thin when
it comes to certain domains, such as web or async programming.

I'm primarily a game developer, and currently work for [Extremely OK Games](https://exok.com/),
where we are developing an action-exploration game called [Earthblade](https://exok.com/games/earthblade/).

I've released many games, the most recent is [Ikenfell](https://www.humblegames.com/games/ikenfell/), which we released
on the *Nintendo Switch*, *Playstation 4*, *XBox One*, *Windows*, and *macOS*.
