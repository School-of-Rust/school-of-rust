I'm Chevy Ray, a coder, writer, artist, and game designer from Canada.

This is my dog, Burnham. Look at her.

I've released many games, the most recent is [Ikenfell](https://www.humblegames.com/games/ikenfell/), which we released
on the *Nintendo Switch*, *Playstation 4*, *XBox One*, and PC.

I've been using Rust for about 2 years now, and it's become my go-to language
for every new project I start up.

The language is so great that I decided  to create this website to help
teach it and give all my free tools and crates a home where people could
find them.

I hope you find it helpful!
